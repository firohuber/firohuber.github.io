								<h1>How Have I changed</h1>
								<p>
									During the class, I noticed a repeating motive. Most of the way we behave and interact originates from our basic instincts. Acknowledging it is the first step and my ability to change and become a better leader. One of the more impactful lessons for me was Leading by Listening. Practicing this aspect both in class and in the conversation for Leadership Ladder 2 showed me how powerful this skill is. While I consider myself a good listener, I realized how much I can improve. Since the class, I have emphasized holding myself before responding and taking an active listening rule, which allows me to provide better advice. While I thought it wouldn't be noticeable to others, recently, my wife told me she couldn't put her finger on the reason be she finds our conversations much more enjoyable lately.

									Also, coming from a different country, learning about the importance of diversity and the struggles involved in adjusting to a new culture changed my point of view. Understanding there will be an adjusting period where I have to get familiar with the cultural differences is something I have in mind now.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lastly, while leadership is hard to measure, I learned that it isn't a binary skill but one you can work on. I now have a different point of view on leadership, and my goal is to keep developing it.
